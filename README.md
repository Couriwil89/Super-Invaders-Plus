# Super-Invaders-P
 Final Project 2020
 
 Final Project for IT-3049C - Web Game Development.
 
 
 To play, you will need MAMP or an equivalent service. All testing was done in Google Chrome.
 
 To play, you will need to use the spacebar and arrow keys. Left and right move the ship. Spacebar is primary fire, and Down arrow is the special missile; the ammunition is diplayed on the bottom right. You will need to find ammo to use it. Gameplay loop is as follows: defeat 2 waves of invaders 
 and a boss for every third level. The invaders will start at a marginally faster speed with each successful level cleared, looping forever.
 
 The missiles are used primarily for the boss at the moment, and has no effect on the aliens by design.
